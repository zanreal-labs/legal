ZANREAL Labs develops products and features designed to help developers rapidly create their next website or project. Our innovative tools harness the latest advancements in AI technology to provide a seamless and accelerated development experience. This Policy outlines ZANREAL Labs approach to responsibly developing, deploying, and using artificial intelligence ("AI") in our products and services (collectively, "AI Products"). You may select or purchase offerings from third parties through ZANREAL Labs AI Integrations, or other similar services, which are not covered by this Policy.

## ZANREAL Labs AI Products and Your Data

ZANREAL Labs AI Products consist of tools that help users generate code and user interfaces, improve their technical skills, and build, debug, and ship web applications, including through a generative chat assistant. These AI Products enhance user productivity and improve the development experience from the initial stages of project conception to the final stages of deployment.

We take our responsibility seriously to protect user data and be transparent about how such data is used. User input and prompt content, queries, ratings, and/or other interactions with user generations and other output may be used by ZANREAL Labs (and as applicable, our Third-Party Service Providers' models) to generate outputs. Such content may also be used by ZANREAL Labs (but not by third parties') models and learning systems to improve our AI Products and provide more accurate and relevant recommendations to our users. Users can opt out of training our AI Products by purchasing the appropriate subscription. ZANREAL Labs does not use customer source code or content hosted on ZANREAL Labs platform services to train, improve, or fine tune any of the models used in ZANREAL Labs AI Products.

## Acceptable Use
