title: Modern Slavery Act Statement
description: ZanReal Labs' commitment to combating modern slavery and human trafficking in our business operations and supply chains
---

ZanReal Labs ("ZanReal Labs") is committed to conducting our business ethically and responsibly and improving our practices to combat modern slavery in our business by taking steps, to the extent we are able, to ensure that our supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. We recognize the importance of the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and the role we play in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not present in our business operations and supply chains.

This statement sets out the steps we have taken to understand potential modern slavery risks within our business structure and supply chain, as well as the steps taken to eradicate these risks. References to "we" or "our" in this statement are references to ZanReal Labs.

## Our Firm

ZanReal Labs is a comprehensive technology services provider offering software development services, marketing services, remote IT support, SEO optimization, UI/UX design services, cloud platforms, and related professional services. Our integrated platform and managed infrastructure services provide customers with the tools, workflows, and expertise they need to build, deploy, optimize, and scale their digital presence and business operations.

ZanReal Labs opposes modern slavery and human trafficking in all forms and supports the UK and the US governments' efforts to prohibit such trafficking in persons. We do not tolerate any form of slavery, forced labor, or human trafficking in any part of our business or supply chain. We are committed to ensuring that our business is conducted in an ethical manner, which includes respecting human rights and avoiding any involvement, directly or indirectly, with slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking.

## Our Supply Chain

ZanReal Labs has its headquarters in San Francisco and a largely distributed, global workforce.

Our supply chain primarily consists of goods and services, including but not limited to, computing and software services, event planning, catering services, IT equipment, recruitment agencies, purchase of retail items, office supplies, office cleaning services, food and beverage, leasing of facilities, such as office space and data centers, and professional services, such as legal and accounting firms.

We have reviewed our supply chain and believe the overall risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our organization to be low on the basis of:

The nature of ZanReal Labs' business model. We are not subject to sudden changes in workload or pricing pressures that can increase the risk of forced labor in supply chains.

The nature of our products and services. We do not conduct manufacturing or produce hardware, nor does ZanReal Labs offer services often performed by migrant workers.

The locations from which we operate and procure goods and services for our products. We offer free and paid web-based platform-as-a-service to customers all over the world, mostly in developed markets.

Our procurement practices. We agree to reasonable terms and ensure timely payment for our suppliers.

## Our Policies on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking

We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or in any part of our business. Our internal policies reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chain.

We strive to provide competitive compensation and benefits to our employees and contractors regardless of location. This is true whether we hire independent contractors directly or through an intermediary.

Additionally, every employee has the right to raise concerns about values, ethics and professional conduct without fear of retaliation. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns relating to potential violations of laws, policies, professional standards and values, in a confidential manner, through clearly defined internal channels and anonymously, where legally permissible. If employees are unsure or have questions about the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking, they are able to consult their manager, the executive team, human resources, legal, and ask anonymously through a third-party application.

## Risk Assessment and Due Diligence Processes

Although our direct exposure to supply chain risks may be limited due to the nature of our business and operations, we recognize the importance of being proactive. To help identify and monitor the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain we have established a supplier due diligence process to assess our third-party relationships through a standard risk profiling and assessment process. We require suppliers to fully comply with applicable laws and expect them to enact practices to ensure compliance with such laws.

We have also raised awareness of risks related to slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain with colleagues who manage the procurement and supplier vetting process. To date, we have not discovered any modern slavery in our business or supply chain and have no credible basis to believe that it is occurring.

## Ongoing Steps

ZanReal Labs is fully committed to fulfilling our responsibilities under the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015.

We acknowledge the importance of awareness and education in combating modern slavery and human trafficking. As part of our commitment, we will explore opportunities to provide our employees with the necessary training and resources to recognize and prevent these practices.

We understand the importance of maintaining transparency and are dedicated to continuously improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. We will regularly review our policies and procedures to ensure they are effective and aligned with our commitment to ethical business conduct.

Any concerns and/or complaints arising under or related to the Acts should be reported to <legal@zanreal.com>.

This statement is made for the financial year ending January 31, 2026. It was signed by the CEO on May 30, 2025.
