We use cookies and similar technologies. This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies in connection with our Services and your related choices.

ZanReal Labs provides comprehensive technology solutions including software development, marketing services, remote IT support, SEO optimization, and UI/UX design. This policy covers cookie usage across all our digital touchpoints, including our website, client platforms, marketing campaigns, and service delivery systems.

Capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy but not defined here will have the meanings given to them in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).
You may also contact us at [privacy@zanreal.com](mailto:privacy@zanreal.com) with any additional questions.

## What are Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many technology service providers, we use cookies across our various digital touchpoints. Cookies — and similar technologies — do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies and other technologies may also be used to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, SEO performance, track service delivery metrics, and otherwise assist us in making your use of our Services and digital platforms more relevant and useful to you.

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code on a web page or in an email notification. Pixels allow companies to collect information such as an individual's IP address, when the individual viewed the pixel and the type of browser used. We use pixel tags to understand whether you've interacted with content on our websites, marketing emails, or client platforms, which helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience.

Local storage allows a website to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. Local storage is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with our Services, including preferences for our software solutions, marketing content, and support tools.

It is important to understand that cookies (and the technologies listed above) collect personal information as well as non-identifiable information.

## How and Why do We Use Cookies?

We use both 1st party cookies (which are set by us) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our websites). Some of the cookies or similar technologies that we use are "strictly necessary" in that they are essential to our Services. Without them, our websites and service delivery platforms will not work properly. Other cookies or similar technologies, while not essential, help us improve our Services, measure service performance, optimize our marketing efforts, enhance SEO effectiveness, and analyze user interactions. Why we use cookies is described below in more detail.

**Strictly Necessary or Essential Cookies**: These cookies are necessary for our Services to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you when accessing client portals, maintain secure sessions during remote IT support, and enable core functionality of software solutions we develop. When you log on to our websites or client platforms, authentication cookies are set which let us know who you are during a browsing session. We have to load essential cookies for legitimate interests pursued by us in delivering our Services' essential functionality to you.

**Functionality Cookies**: These cookies are used to enable certain additional functionality across our Services, such as storing your preferences (e.g. username, service preferences, dashboard configurations) and assisting us in providing support, software customization, or payment services so we know your browser or operating system. This functionality improves user experience across our software development, UI/UX design, and IT support services, enabling us to provide better Services and more efficient platforms.

**Performance and Analytics Cookies**: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites and Services. They help us to know which pages are most popular, how visitors navigate our sites, and how they interact with our software solutions. Performance cookies are used to help us with our analytics, including compiling statistics about service usage, marketing campaign effectiveness, SEO performance metrics, and user interaction patterns across all our digital touchpoints.
