## Procedures

If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the owner and/or administrator of a website or digital content created through ZanReal Labs services after submitting a complaint to the DMCA agent designated by the owner and/or administrator, ZanReal Labs will follow the below procedures with respect to Notices of Infringement and Counter-Notifications.

**Prior to Filing a Notice of Infringement with ZanReal Labs**: An owner of a copyright should conduct its own due diligence to ascertain whether the owner in fact owns the copyright to an original work and whether the content on a website, application, or digital material created through ZanReal Labs services constitutes an unauthorized use of the content and/or infringes on the owner's copyright and must first have attempted to resolve the issue with the owner and/or administrator of the website or content.

**Filing a Notice of Infringement**: If the copyright owner's investigation confirms that the owner actually owns the copyright and that the content posted on the website, application, or created through ZanReal Labs services is unauthorized or infringes on the owner's copyright, the owner (hereinafter referred to as the "**Complainant**") should prepare and submit a Notice of Infringement to ZanReal Labs through the Designated Agent. The Notice of Infringement should include all of the statutory requirements listed below and should be sufficiently detailed. Upon receipt of the Notice of Infringement, ZanReal Labs Designated Agent will notify the owner(s) of the content of the copyright infringement claim in the Notice of Infringement. Please note that ZanReal Labs does not monitor or police deployments, applications, or content created through our services, and if content is taken offline, it is possible that a client may recreate similar content through our services (and may be subject to a new DMCA complaint).

Resolving the Notice of Infringement:

- To the extent that the Notice of Infringement properly alleges that the entirety of the contents or materials of a website, application, or digital content created through ZanReal Labs services infringe on the Complainant's copyright, ZanReal Labs will take appropriate action including disabling the deployment, content, or service access at issue.
- Since ZanReal Labs provides various technology services and may have limited ability to disable specific content depending on the service type, in the event that the Notice of Infringement properly alleges that only portions of the content infringe the copyrights of the Complainant, ZanReal Labs will work with the content owner to address the specific infringing materials while preserving legitimate content where technically feasible.

**Filing a Counter-Notification**: Where allegedly infringing material was removed (or access to it disabled) in response to a Notice of Infringement, the owner(s) of the content should consult with a professional and/or lawyer about their options and circumstances. If you, as the owner(s) of the content, believe that material you created or published through ZanReal Labs services was wrongfully removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you can file a Counter-Notification with ZanReal Labs through its Designated Agent. ZanReal Labs will then promptly provide a copy of the Counter-Notification to the Complainant who originally filed the Notice of Infringement.

**Copyright Owner's Right to File a Lawsuit**: ZanReal Labs will promptly replace the removed material or restore access to it within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days after receiving the Counter-Notification from the owner(s) of the content, unless ZanReal Labs Designated Agent receives notice from the Complainant that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the owner(s) of the content from engaging in infringing activity pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)(b) of the DMCA.

## Notice of Infringement

ZanReal Labs will promptly respond to Notices of Infringement that comply with applicable laws and ZanReal Labs DMCA Policy. In the event you believe any materials accessible on or from a website, application, or digital content created through ZanReal Labs services infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those allegedly infringing materials (or access to them) by submitting a written notification to ZanReal Labs copyright agent designated below. Before doing so, please first attempt to resolve the issue with the content owner or administrator.

Pursuant to Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, the written notice must include the following:

- Your physical or electronic signature.
- Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed (or a representative list of works if the claim involves multiple works), including copies of, or references to, URLs where your copyrighted works reside so that we can verify that you are the copyright owner.
- Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow ZanReal Labs to locate that material.
- Adequate information by which ZanReal Labs can contact you (including your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address).
- A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials is unauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the Notice of Infringement is accurate.
- A statement, under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your Notice of Infringement may not be effective. Furthermore, if you knowingly and materially misrepresent that the material created through ZanReal Labs services is infringing your copyright, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

## Counter-Notification

If you are a ZanReal Labs customer and believe that material you posted on a website deployed through the ZanReal Labs Platform was wrongfully removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you can file a counter-notification with ZanReal Labs ("**Counter-Notification**"), pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA, by submitting written notification to our Designated Agent identified above.

Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notification must substantially include the following:

- Your physical or electronic signature.
- An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, along with the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled.
- Adequate information by which ZanReal Labs can contact you (including, your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address).
- A statement by you, under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
- A statement by you that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district that your address is located (or if you reside outside the USA, for any judicial district in which the website may be found) and that you will accept service of process from the person (or that person's agent) who provided ZanReal Labs with the Notice of Infringement at issue.

ZanReal Labs designee to receive Counter-Notifications is the Designated Agent listed above.

Please note that the DMCA allows ZanReal Labs to restore the removed content if the party filing the original Notice of Infringement does not file a court action against you within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days of receiving the copy of your Counter-Notification. You should also be aware that if you knowingly and materially misrepresent that the material on the website hosted by ZanReal Labs was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

## Repeat Offenders

It is ZanReal Labs policy, in certain circumstances and in its sole discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of customers who are repeat infringers upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.
