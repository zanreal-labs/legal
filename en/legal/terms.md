If you are located and headquartered in the United States of America, you and ZanReal Labs each irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the San Francisco County, California for all proceedings arising out of this contract or related to the parties' relationship, and you and ZanReal Labs agree to only institute such proceedings in those courts.

#### 19.3.2. Disputes with a Foreign Customer

If you are located and headquartered outside of the United States of America, then any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law. Any dispute between you and ZanReal Labs that is not resolved through negotiation will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then-current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of you and ZanReal Labs or, if you and ZanReal Labs cannot agree, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the JAMS rules who shall be experienced in the type of dispute at issue. You and ZanReal Labs, their representatives, the arbitrator, and other participants shall keep confidential the existence, content, and result of the arbitration. Any demand for arbitration and any counterclaim must specify in reasonable detail the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the claimant's claims and include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed, if any, and any other remedy sought by the claimant. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language; the location of such arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Each party will bear its own costs in the arbitration. The arbitrator will have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to interpret or construe the provisions of the agreement documents and to fashion appropriate remedies (including temporary, preliminary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief); provided that the arbitrator will not have any right or authority: (i) in excess of the authority that a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the dispute would have absent this arbitration agreement; or (ii) to award damages in excess of the types and limitation of damages found in the Agreement. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, each party may apply at any time to a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate injunctive relief or for other interim or conservatory measures, and by doing so will not breach or waive the agreement to arbitrate or impair the powers of the arbitrator.

#### 19.3.3. Opt-Out

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: <legal@zanreal.com> with the subject line "COMPANY ARBITRATION OPT-OUT".
